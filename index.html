                            The scope of this project covers the design and development of an integrated digital
hospitality solution that leverages Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance customer interaction and service personalization.
The system consists of three core components: an AR-Based 3D Food Visualization
and Ordering System, a VR Hotel Tour Platform, and an AI-Driven Room
Suggestion System. The AR module allows customers to view realistic 3D food
models, customize meals, and place orders directly through mobile or web applications.
The VR module provides immersive hotel tours, enabling customers to explore rooms
and facilities before booking. The AI component analyzes user preferences to
recommend suitable accommodation options, improving decision-making and
satisfaction. Together, these modules create a unified platform that transforms
traditional dining and hotel booking experiences into interactive, intelligent, and user-
centered digital services.

                    Despite the rapid digital transformation in the hospitality and food service industries,
current online systems still face major limitations in visualization, personalization, and
interactivity. Traditional digital menus rely on static images and text descriptions, which
fail to convey the true appearance, portion size, and presentation of food items.
Similarly, most hotel booking platforms lack immersive experiences that allow customers
to explore facilities before making reservations, and they offer limited personalization
when recommending rooms. These shortcomings reduce customer engagement,
increase uncertainty, and lead to mismatched expectations. Therefore, there is a need
for an integrated system that combines AR, VR, and AI technologies to provide
realistic visualization, immersive exploration, and intelligent personalization in food
ordering and hotel booking experiences.

                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="reasearch-gap-pane" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="profile-tab"
                    tabindex="0">
                    Although numerous online food ordering and hotel booking systems exist, most current
platforms focus primarily on convenience and transaction efficiency rather than
immersive user experience or personalization. Existing digital menus typically rely on
2D images and textual descriptions, which fail to provide realistic visualization of food
items, leading to customer dissatisfaction and uncertainty in purchase decisions.
Similarly, while Virtual Reality (VR) has been explored in tourism, its adoption in hotel
booking remains limited, with few systems offering fully interactive virtual tours.
Additionally, AI-driven personalization in accommodation recommendation systems
often depends only on basic filters such as price or location, lacking adaptive learning
based on user preferences and behaviors. There is limited integration of AR, VR, and
AI technologies within a unified platform that connects food visualization, virtual hotel
exploration, and intelligent room suggestions. This research addresses this gap by
proposing a combined framework that enhances customer engagement, visualization
accuracy, and decision-making in the hospitality sector.

                    The scope of this project includes the development of an integrated digital solution that
enhances the hospitality and food service experience using Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. The AR module
enables customers to visualize 3D models of food items, customize ingredients, and
place orders directly through mobile or web platforms. The VR component allows users
to take immersive virtual tours of hotel rooms and facilities before making a booking
decision. The AI module analyzes customer preferences and behavior to provide
personalized room recommendations, improving satisfaction and decision accuracy.
The project focuses on improving user engagement, interactivity, and operational
efficiency, providing a smart, seamless, and immersive digital experience for both
customers and service providers in the hospitality industry.

                        The development of the integrated AR-Based Food Menu, VR Hotel Tour, and AI-
Driven Room Suggestion System follows a structured, user-centered, and iterative
approach. The process begins with requirement analysis through stakeholder interviews
and surveys to identify user expectations for realistic food visualization, immersive hotel
exploration, and personalized room recommendations. The system is designed
modularly, with a cloud-based backend for data management, and interactive frontends
for mobile and web platforms. AR and VR components are developed using Unity 3D,
Three.js, and WebXR to provide immersive experiences, while AI algorithms in Python
and TensorFlow power personalized room suggestions. Iterative testing, including
usability studies and performance evaluation, ensures the system is functional, secure,
and user-friendly. Feedback from each phase informs refinements, resulting in a
seamless, immersive, and intelligent digital solution for the hospitality and food service
industries.
